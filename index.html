		The General Plan: The webpage will be the snake game. When a user visits the page,
		they'll be met with the snake game, but with a twist, where there will be multiple
		"bites", each representing a section of the webpage (these bites will be randomly
		placed but evenly spaced out). Snatching a given bite will open the section's
		corresponding link in a new tab, and will cause the game to pause. Now the
		snatched bite doesn't disappear (but maybe grows the snake?), and the user can
		resume and snatch other bites. At any point, the user can switch to straight up
		playing the snake game.
